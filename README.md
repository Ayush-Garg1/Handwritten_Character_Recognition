# Dataset


<h6>I have used Balanced EMNIST dataset</h6>
<h4>Balanced dataset </h4>
The EMNIST Balanced dataset is meant to address the balance issues in the ByClass and ByMerge datasets. It is derived from the ByMerge dataset to reduce mis-classification errors due to capital and lower case letters and also has an equal number of samples per class. This dataset is meant to be the most applicable.</br>
